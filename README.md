# Direct Stereo Rectification
Analytic algorithm to compute best homographies for stereo rectification with minimum perspective distortion and without using iterative methods.
An elaboration of the procedure originally introduced by Charles Loop and Zhengyou Zhang in _“Computing rectifying homographies for stereo vision”_ (1999), DOI: 10.1109/CVPR.1999.786928.
